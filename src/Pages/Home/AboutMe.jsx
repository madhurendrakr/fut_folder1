            "Hello! I'm currently in my final year of undergraduate studies,
            pursuing a B.tch degree at NIT Agartala. My academic journey has
            been a rewarding exploration of development. Alongside my
            coursework, I've actively participated in extracurricular
            activities, teamwork, or projects to broaden my knowledge and apply
            what I've learned in real-world contexts. As I approach graduation,
            I'm excited to embark on the next chapter of my life, where I hope
            to contribute my skills and passion to make a meaningful impact in
            software domain. Feel free to connect and share your experiences or
            insightsâ€”I'm always eager to learn and grow!"
